# Shapes Example

A quick example while I figure out a good way to structure and build the project.

## Building the project

Use the included Makefile to build binaries, generate documentation and execute unit tests.

To build the complete project including doucmentation and unit tests:  
`make all`

To generate documentation:  
`make docs`

To generate and execute unit tests:  
`make test`

To clean project files:  
`make clean`
